    <p>What <em>is</em> Freedom, actually?</p>

<p>Of course, there are vocabulary definitions and all kinds of biases surrounding us, when it comes to freedom. You might think money means freedom, for example.</p>

<p>But does it really?</p>

<p>I wanted to find out what freedom really means to people that live around me. So, <a href="https://youtu.be/tbzNkABsb2I">I hit the streets of Potsdam</a>, Germany with my camera and a directional microphone, to find out what people think.</p>

<p><strong>What is Freedom?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#what-is-freedom-to-you-germany">What is freedom to you, Germany?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#freedom-in-ukraine">Freedom in Ukraine</a></li>
  <li><a href="#freedom-in-japan">Freedom in Japan</a></li>
  <li><a href="#freedom-in-korea">Freedom in Korea</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-freedom-to-you-germany">What is freedom to you, Germany?</h2>

<p>It was my first street interview kind of operation. Not gonna lie: it’s intimidating to approach people you don’t know (introverts will understand). More so, carrying a big-*ss camera and doing it in the country, where citizens are known to be extremely concerned about privacy.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, I didn’t get shouted at even once (what I was afraid of the most). Maybe, because I used common sense and didn’t start rolling until I will have gotten a consent for being filmed.</p>

<p>I did get rejected of course. For the aforementioned privacy concerns, as well as people just being busy, it was in the middle of a work week after all.</p>

<p>One guy though, asked if he’s gonna get paid for it, lol. After finding out that he wasn’t, he refused.</p>

<p>In the end of the day I was surprised to get a wide variety of answers: from famous quotes, to simple, but very much to the point answers.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tbzNkABsb2I"><img src="/assets/img/what-is-freedom/what-is-freedom-DE.jpg" alt="What Is Freedom? A street interview" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tbzNkABsb2I">Click here</a> to watch it on YouTube.</p>

<p>As a bonus I’ve added subtitles, so you can follow along and learn some German or English this way too!</p>

<h2 id="freedom-in-ukraine">Freedom in Ukraine</h2>

<p>Originally, I intended to film more in various German cities, asking this and other questions. I even started filming a bit in Berlin but never published due to lack of material and I moved out of Germany soon after.</p>

<p>What can I say, life happens.</p>

<p>But during my visit to Ukraine in winter 2023-2024, I realized it’s a good opportunity to ask about freedom there, especially given the country is fighting (still, at the time of writing) for its freedom and existence.</p>

<p>It was harder to film there. After years of war, people are exhausted and it’s understandable.</p>

<p>Many people refused being interviewed: you never know what tomorrow brings, who is going to control the city and how the video is going to be used by russians if they find and watch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SC90q1nd8NU">They don’t need many excuses</a> to put you down in a “pit” after all.</p>

<p>Besides, <a href="https://youtu.be/YnhPgRQU9lw">I was busy with some other things</a> while in Ukraine, so didn’t interview nearly as many people as I would’ve liked. And only when I was editing later, I realized I could use some more B-roll too, actually.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here is my update on the same topic from Ukraine:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hCs0VErN8kY"><img src="/assets/img/what-is-freedom/what-is-freedom-UA.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hCs0VErN8kY">Click here</a> to watch it on YouTube.</p>

<h2 id="freedom-in-japan">Freedom in Japan</h2>

<p>Fast forward some months later, I also asked the same question in Japan. I filmed it in Tokyo, in one day. Luckily, I had a friend help me with the translation.</p>

<p>To my surprise, one of the first answers I got was “there is no freedom”. Which is very philosophical, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Another surprising thing was that I didn’t get nearly as many rejections as I was prepping myself for, even with my very limited Japanese. From yongsters and construction workers to masters of calligraphy and even idol music band members: I was happy to hear all their interesting answers, and now you can too.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DYF5VfrvNpI"><img src="/assets/img/what-is-freedom/what-is-freedom.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>At this point, it looked like it’s becoming a series, so I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYF5VfrvNpI&amp;list=PLaXB0_6a3rLglJP6c1Z9sVsC46Bb30YjK">created a playlist here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="freedom-in-korea">Freedom in Korea</h2>

<p>In Korea, I took a different approach and asked people from all over the country as I traveled around it a bit in the fall of 2024.</p>

<p>I tried to talk to some servicemen from the military and approached a couple of cops too, but all of them refused being on camera citing being on the duty.</p>

<p>Also, it has proven to be a challenge to get older folks to speak out, although I did meet a couple of very interesting characters and some of them spoke English really well.</p>

<p>Despite that, I got some interesting answers this time around as well. 
With an interesting bonus too: one of the guys I approached in Seoul turned out to be an artist from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ahnsub">the band Animal Divers</a>!</p>

<p>This is my video from Korea:</p>
