    <p>So I went to <a href="https://www.momat.go.jp/en/collection/o00937">The National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo</a> the other day and the painting that has impressed me the most is probably this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/ukraine/the-base-by-hiroshi-nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>“The Base” by Hiroshi Nakamura. While it’s not exactly about war, the author actually made it as a response to an incident at an American military base in Japan in 1957, known as Girard incident, I think the general feeling of the image and emotions it evokes match very well to today’s topic.</p>

<p>As we are well into the 10th year of Russo-Ukrainian war and who knows what year of Palestinian struggle for independence as well as Israel’s fight for its right to exist among other ongoing and potentially erupting new conflicts, the question is more actual than ever: can we stop wars? </p>

<p>Yes this is one of the more serious topics, but I feel like we need to talk about it, given we <a href="https://youtu.be/YnhPgRQU9lw">live and… die in very turbulent times</a>. And, possibly even more worrying, with the boom of the AI and LLM technologies we might soon experience even more, well, turbulence. You know, as it usually happens with the invention of new technologies that can be used for warfare.</p>

<p>But it’s the 21st century, I mean come on, we’re not monkeys in a forest anymore or barbarians with stalinist methods, or… are we?</p>

<p>We have the wisdom of the humankind at the reach of our hand in our smartphones, with all the problems we as a civilization facing today, like poverty, access to healthcare and the climate change, do we really have nothing better to do than wage wars? How do we stop wars? Let’s try to figure this out. </p>

<p><em>You can keep on reading or check out <a href="https://youtu.be/gDctPVCEXI8">the video I made on the topic here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="cease-hostilities-cease-fire">Cease hostilities, cease… fire?</h2>

<p>First off, you can’t *just* stop a war, let alone all wars. All parties might agree to a ceasefire, but any war has to come to its logical conclusion, otherwise it will reignite with new force sooner or later. We see this constantly on the examples of Russian war against Ukraine or in Palestine-Israel conflict where ceasefire agreements are made just to be broken later. If the ceasefire for one reason or another lasts for a long time, without the issue being actually resolved, it’s called a frozen conflict.</p>

<p>This is also quite a common occurrence, we see it in the russian puppet pseudo-state in Transnistria, practically an occupied part of Moldova, as well as russian-occupied parts of Georgia, North-South Korea conflict and even PRC-ROC conflict which essentially is a frozen civil war. Basically it’s about parties waiting for the situation to change to reignite the conflict from a more favorable position or potentially take over using soft power.</p>

<p>Unless it’s a minor (by scale and number of victims) border conflict like China-Soviet Russia border clashes in 1969, you can’t just give up either. And even in cases like that one, if you do give up, it might have implications in the larger political games big boys in tight suits like to play.</p>

<p>We can endlessly discuss war in abstract, but without concrete examples we won’t come anywhere. But for me personally, war is far from being some abstract concept I can discuss while sitting in the comfort and safety of my warm and cozy Western European or American home. It’s a very real, almost tangible thing my family, friends and I have to live with. And while I’m doing quite fine here in Japan currently, my friends and family were less lucky and some of them have to literally fight for their own freedom and by extension keeping the rest of Europe safe… for now.</p>

<p>But if only Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire, wouldn’t there be peace? In fact, why not just give russians what they want, stop the bloodshed and just live peacefully? You often hear variants of this, mostly from European left and… some others, like my aunt who is far from being dumb, but who sold her soul working for russian military-industrial complex. But we’ll come back to the topic of traitors some other time.</p>

<h2 id="a-concrete-example">A concrete example</h2>

<p>As for why ceasefires don’t really work, we see it on the example of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, where the Ukrainian state being at its weakest point after the revolution in early 2014 and with the president and his government having fled to Russia, under a lot of the pressure from some Western countries among other things, temporary political leadership gave up Crimea to russians without a fight. Did it stop the war from happening?</p>

<p>Quite the opposite, as you can see with the ongoing russian invasion that started in 2022. Excited by their success in Crimea, which they took with little blood of several Ukrainian soldiers, russians ignited the war in the Eastern regions of Ukraine and tried to do the same in the Southern regions.</p>

<p>I know what I’m talking about because I’ve been there as the events were unfolding in front of my eyes, not just watching it via prism of media like people do these days, it’s almost like a reality show for some. I’ve seen the pro-russian “demonstrations” being organized in cities like Odesa and my hometown of Mykolaiv, where of course there were some locals who truly believed russian propaganda being pumped in the brains of Ukrainian citizens via russian propaganda news channels, TV-shows, movies, concerts and other means.</p>

<p>But what I’ve also seen were some russians who arrived to the city, didn’t know the street names and tried to navigate the city via public transportation, asking the locals. I can only assume they were being paid to do that. I know this because I’ve witnessed it myself and heard their very specific Russian dialects. A lot of people speak Russian in Ukraine, but they don’t speak it the way those people did.</p>

<p>As russians pretended they do not actually fight the war in 2014-2015 by cleverly removing the insignia from their uniforms and painting over identifying signs, they tried to recruit and coerce as many locals as they could and indeed they did not extensively use aviation in Ukrainian airspace outside of Crimea. They did use MLRS Grad, and artillery from across the border to shell Ukrainian cities in the East though. Once the situation looked like Ukraine will regain control in the East, russians came in with real reinforcements, forcing Ukraine to a ceasefire and what came to be known as Minsk agreements. Everybody understood from the get-go it’s a temporary solution. And “the ceasefire”, while technically somewhat worked in terms of no big advancements were made by either side, the so called “contact line” turned into a shooting range where russians would send their snipers, hell, even TV stars to shoot and train on live Ukrainian targets. Ukraine did not have resources or leverage to regain the lost territories and save people from russian occupation, also suffering from political fights inside the country, while Russia hoped to use the Minsk agreements as a backdoor to get russian assets into Ukrainian parliament and government to control all of Ukraine.</p>

<p>So, no matter how many times bots “independent thinkers” and useful idiots and not only tell you something among the lines that the West must abandon Ukraine and it must negotiate a ceasefire with Russia, what is their intention? And what that negotiation is going to look like? Russia is the aggressor here, the only thing they are willing to negotiate is how much land they are gonna get to satisfy them *for now*. There were countless attempts at ceasefire since 2014 and russians never respected it, all the while the civilian population of the eastern regions suffered the most, the very same people russians claimed they were “protecting”.</p>

<p>It’s not like ceasefires can’t be good for anything at all. They might be a useful tool for a specific purpose, like evacuation of civilians or what russians are trying to achieve these days like getting rearmed and their military back in shape to attack with new force later. And yet, despite their constant lies and their favorite tactics of throwing a lot of false “theories” out there that all require time and effort debunking, a lot of people still believe them and take everything they say at face value. Or even if they don’t believe russians, such people see the United States as the evil empire which only provokes and starts wars, which I’m not saying it doesn’t by the way, they got in a lot of wars they shouldn’t have. But if you see the United States and their politics, modern imperialism if you will, as your enemy, it doesn’t mean Russia is your friend. These very same people who are so appalled by American imperialism fail to see the imperial ambitions of russians, even though they are openly state it all the time, everywhere from state TV in prime time to social media and private conversations. </p>

<p>Ceasefire or rather an armistice, *kind of* worked for North Korea though, largely because of the unique circumstances like death of Stalin. But hey, look how it turned out for them, especially for North Korea, who are doing well and prosper, right?</p>

<p>In more complicated conflicts where it’s even less black and white like the war in Syria which has seen so many parties involved a lot of them hating each other in the worst way possible. If it’s so hard to make 2 parties sit down and talk, how do you go about making at least 4 sides I’ve counted in Syria and that’s only those actively fighting, likely more. In Israel and Palestine ceasefires are even less likely to work due to the nature of borders or lack thereof, because of how the history, culture, religion and everything is intertwined and simple lack of incentives, especially for the radical groups.</p>

<h2 id="so-can-we-stop-wars">So can we stop wars?</h2>

<p>So we can’t “stop a war” with a ceasefire, not realistically at least, how can we “stop a war” like this then? The right way to stop such a war would be to make sure the aggressor loses the war and ensure the regime change, setting up a system of checks, ideally under international control, so similar attempts don’t happen in the future. So how do we do that? I don’t know a better mechanism than a military defeat. </p>

<h2 id="what-about-preventing-wars-from-happening">What about preventing wars from happening?</h2>

<p>So then how do we prevent future wars? If wars are just a part of or one of the ways of doing politics, surely we can “do politics” by other means, without resorting to war and violence?</p>

<p>Well… I’m not quite sure about that.</p>

<p>Turning to evolutionary sciences, some argue maybe it’s men. Driven by instincts to maximize reproduction, compete violently for mates and by extension new territories. This is about subconscious desire for more sexual partners, which manifested itself clearly in the past like conquering and taking women captive.</p>

<p>I think… While if you look at the macro level, violence against women still happens in war, but it’s hard for me to imagine it’s a factor for starting wars, let alone that it could be a main factor. Usually, there are many things involved, like money *hello, it’s always about money*, staying in power (hello, Putin), some personal issues, traumas or feeling of greatness.</p>

<p>But more so, I think it’s just in our blood.</p>

<p>I like to describe it like this. Imagine our planet as a petri dish, you know the thing for growing or testing bacteria? When there is enough space and food, two different kinds of bacteria can grow along and coexist peacefully, but as space and/or food becomes scarce, well, guess what happens. They will compete for resources and the more “aggressive” type, meaning the one that reproduces faster or produces antibiotics is going to “win”.</p>

<p>So while some argue including more women in leadership can promote peace, you know, because of their alleged evolutionary focus on raising offspring leads them to prioritize stability and lessens the drive for violent conflict… I say, yea even if it worked and even then how you do that, ban all men from all positions, because they still might be influencing politics even if not directly. It’s not historically viable solution either, there were some female leaders and some prominent too, it didn’t lead to less war. Besides, what do you do about that other side that still wants to destroy you, hm?</p>

<h2 id="overpopulation">Overpopulation</h2>

<p>…is a word a lot of people don’t like to hear, especially politicians and corporations. And while it’s a big topic on its own, let’s talk more about it some other time, I consider it a big factor for wars. You might say, but hey, there’s plenty of space, we can fit a couple more billinos easily. We sure could, but would you wanna live in a world like that? Russia has plenty of territory, but nobody really wonts to live in remote underdeveloped regions with cold climate. So if we want to prevent future wars we might wanna tackle this one, I believe.</p>

<p>But before that comes around, what can we do? Drugs?</p>

<p>There is a documentary called <strong>The Sunshine Makers</strong>, where one guy from the “Brotherhood of Eternal Love” wanted to drug the entire world, starting with the United States, with acid. Well, that didn’t work. Besides, how do we know dictators like Putin are not on drugs already? We are all different. Some substance that makes one person a hippie might make another person a maniac. Just look at Mr. Musk and where his trips with ketamine are taking him.</p>

<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/empty-concrete-road-covered-surrounded-by-tall-tress-with-sun-rays-3Kv48NS4WUU"><img src="/assets/img/ukraine/hope.jpeg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2 id="so-is-there-hope-at-all">So is there hope at all?</h2>

<p>It’s a part of bigger struggle of how do we select (elect) smart and wise leaders to lead our nations. Should there be national states in the first place? How do we improve life across the globe and stop treating the symptoms like accepting refugees in Europe instead of fixing the problem and improve the situation in the places people escape from?</p>

<p>My favorite example is what if tomorrow an alien civilization visits us? Let’s imagine they would be more intelligent than us and for the sake of the argument let’s say they would be not something like super-intelligence, just creatures that got their shit together. What do we have to say and show to them? Yes, we built a couple of space telescopes and… thousands of cruise ships? We got an amazing thing called Internet and ChatGPT and we surely use it for… well… Generating what exactly?</p>

<p>Do we as a civilization even have anyone to talk to the alien civilization? Who’s it gonna be? That UN dude? Wow and he decides what and is responsible for what exactly?</p>

<p>But yeah, let’s say we pick the two most powerful officials on the planet at the time and a couple of actually intelligent and educated people to back them up. Like, you know, scientists and psychologists-sociologists that ideally also know a thing or two outside of their fields… and oh yeah, that can do more than just wave and fall down. What are they gonna say to this intelligent life form from another planet?</p>

<p>“Yeah, well, we got this thing going on…”</p>

<p>But what’s the plan, Joe?</p>

<p>“But hey, we’re planning to reduce gas emissions by 0,00001 percent maybe, in 50 years so we don’t die, but the other guys have to do it first!”</p>

<p>I’m not even talking about like a somewhat long-term development plan for our civilization, what about just strategic management for the next 10 years? We can’t even ban ducking single use plastic bags. I’m in Japan now and it’s unbelievable how much plastic is being used to wrap a single banana which WHY THE DUCK DOES IT EVEN NEED A CORK SUCKING PLASTIC IN THE FIRST PLACE? Sheesh. What are we talking about if we can’t even figure out this simple problem.</p>

<p>The biggest success I’ve seen so far in this sense is that we’ve solved the disappearing ozone layer problem. Well done, but what about ALL THESE OTHER PROBLEMS?!</p>

<h2 id="can-ai-be-the-solution">Can AI be the solution?</h2>

<p>Honestly, I think it’s more likely bad actors will use it in their interest with evil intent and make things much worse before general artificial intelligence can save us all. There is only one scenario where I see it could work and that would involve some kind of fascist-like regime with artificial intelligence (the real one, not chatGPT) basically controlling us, humans. Might be not the worst case scenario for us, really. But what are the chances? </p>

<p>In conclusion: I don’t have a solution, I’m not claiming to be an expert on the topic either, I’m just some dude on the internet anyway.</p>

<p>But hey can we at least try to elect smarter politicians and if there are none, what about bringing someone forward. Sure, in some places you have to play power and manipulation games to do it.</p>

<p>In places like Russia peaceful change of regime will not work at all.</p>

<p>And in complicated conflicts and places like Palestine, well… I would really love to see more people like Mohammed Darawshe come forward, be highlighted by the media instead of the radical elements currently in power. Politicians with moderate views need to be elected on both sides to be able negotiate peace and coexistence, otherwise it would take a completely radical spin like redrawing the map of Germany after world war 2 in order to stop and prevent violence.</p>

<p>As for Ukraine, <a href="/the-small-town-which-ruined-russias-big-plans-on-odesa">I will keep doing my little part</a> in whatever way I can to make sure the rule based world, the fragile somewhat working somewhat peace we built in Europe after WW2 is restored. And so that there is less incentive for others to start new wars.</p>

<p>We don’t have a better alternative yet.</p>
